# Patterns to add

- Test if the mixed model increases the time to execute the models. 
- Create a test that compares mesh and mixed for:
    - vincular
    - bivincular
    - box
    - consecutive
- See if there is any difference between consecutive and vincular

- Seems when conjure is creating the models, it makes them inside the folder containing the .essence file (or perhaps the file that was supplied first).
When running the script it might be better to actually try and copy that file into the temp folder.
