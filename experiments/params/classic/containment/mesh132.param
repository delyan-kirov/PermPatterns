letting length be 4
$letting avoiding be { ( sequence(1,2,3), relation((1,1)) ) } $ should only be 10 contain, 14 avoid (but that is because the permutation is avoided)

$ finally the pattern in the Bruner&Lackner paper was
letting mesh_containment be { ( sequence(1,3,2), relation((1,0),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(3,1)) ) } $ of length 4; 8 will contain the mesh pattern, 14 will avoid the permutation + 2 will contain the permutation but violate the mesh

$ 16 Solution for avoidance should be
$ Avoiding pattern

$ Contains pattern but breaks mesh
